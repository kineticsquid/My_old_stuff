<!--
<p>The interaction between ARP and Xerces 
seems to include a significant
memory leak possibly caused by Xerces interning some strings, on behalf of ARP.
This feature cannot be turned off.
This is not a new bug, so ARP users will not experience a degradation 
in performance. However, for users who have limited memory, or who are processing
large files, or files from many diverse sources,
or for long-lived applications such as web servers, it is important to
be aware of this leak. I believe that the strings being interned correspond
to the XML element tags and attribute names in the XML document. These
form an open set in RDF/XML, unlike most XML applications.
</p>
<p>
A potential work around is to use a SAX parser other than Xerces and then
use {@link com.hp.hpl.jena.rdf.arp.SAX2Model SAX2Model} or 
{@link com.hp.hpl.jena.rdf.arp.SAX2RDF SAX2RDF} to parse the SAX event stream as RDF.
</p>
<p>
The size of the leak is presumably highly dependent on the actual
RDF/XML documents read. As an example the OWL Guide wine ontology,
(using the version from the OWL Test Cases) contains about 2000 triples
and leaks about 180K.
