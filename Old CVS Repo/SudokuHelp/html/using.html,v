<h1>Using the Puzzle Solver<br>
</h1>
By default, the puzzle solver creates a blank puzzle to solve. With a
blank puzzle, you need to first set the input, or pre-defined, values.
Select a
cell in the puzzle by clicking on it, or by using the arrow keys to
navigate.&nbsp; Enter the input values
in the puzzle by typing a number once you have selected a cell. Erase a
number with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delete</span> or <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">backspace</span> key. Then lock the inputs
by clicking on <img alt="Lock Inputs" title="Lock Inputs"
 src="../images/lock.png" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">.&nbsp;
The cells
with values are shaded and locked so that you can't change their
values.&nbsp; To unlock the inputs,<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>click
on&nbsp;<img alt="Lock Inputs" title="Lock Inputs"
 src="../images/lock.png" style="width: 16px; height: 16px;"> again. <br>
<br>
Now, try to solve the puzzle by entering values in the other cells. If
at any point enter a value in a call that causes the matrix to have an
error, the cells in error are shaded red. Fix this by changing the
value(s) of the cell(s) in error. <br>
<br>
If you are stuck, you can get a hint by clicking on <img alt="Help"
 title="Help" src="../images/help.png"
 style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">. You can only get a hint once you
have locked the
inputs.<br>
<br>
To fill the puzzle in with the solution, click on <img
 alt="Solve Puzzle" title="Solve Puzzle" src="../images/calculator.png"
 style="width: 16px; height: 16px;">. You can only solve the puzzle
once you have
locked the inputs.<br>
<br>
To configure the size of the puzzle, level of difficulty, colors, and
fonts, select <span style="font-weight: bold;">Window</span> &gt; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Preferences </span>and then <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Sudoku</span>.<br>
<br>
Note, a puzzle may have more than one solution. This program attempts
to find only one valid solution.<br>
