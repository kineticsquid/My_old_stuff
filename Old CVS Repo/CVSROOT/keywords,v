@# The "keywords" file is used to modify the standard set of RCS keywords
# or define entirely new ones.
#
# The first entry on a line is a regular expression which is tested
# against the directory that the change is being made to, relative to the
# $CVSROOT.  Subsequent lines contain keyword definitions, indented by a space
# to separate them from module definitions
.#
# If the repository name does not match any of the definitions in this
# file, the "ALL" section is used, if it is specified.
#
# Any keyword with an empty definition is ignored.  This can be used to selectively
# disable individual RCS keywords.
#
# The default defintions are:
#
#ALL
#  Author    %a
#  Date      %d
#  Header    %r/%p/%f %v %d %a %s %l
#  CVSHeader %p/%f %v %d %a %s %l
#  Id        %f %v %d %a %s %l
#  Locker    %l
#  Log		  %f
#  Name      %N
#  RCSfile   %f
#  Revision  %v
#  Source    %r/%p/%f
#  State     %s
#  CommitId  %C
