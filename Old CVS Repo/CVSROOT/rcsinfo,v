@# The "rcsinfo" file is used to control templates with which the editor
# is invoked on commit and import.
#
# The first entry on a line is a regular expression which is tested
# against the directory that the change is being made to, relative to the
# $CVSROOT.  For the first match that is found, then the remainder of the
# line is the name of the file that contains the template.
#
# If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions in this
# file, the "DEFAULT" line is used, if it is specified.
